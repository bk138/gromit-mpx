    <p>
      Gromit-MPX is an on-screen annotation tool that works with any Unix desktop environment under X11 as well as Wayland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its main use is for making presentations of some application. Normally, you would have to move the mouse pointer around the point of interest until hopefully everybody noticed it. With Gromit-MPX, you can draw everywhere onto the screen, highlighting some button or area.
    </p>
    <p>Key features include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Desktop-independent. Gromit-MPX works with GNOME, KDE, XFCE, ... under X11 as well as with a Wayland session</li>
    <li>Hotkey-based. Does not get into your way of doing things by sticking some UI widget on your desktop</li>
    <li>Configurable. You are free to change key bindings as well as drawing tool configuration</li>
    <li>Multi-Pointer. Under X11, it enables graphical annotations with several pointers at once</li>
    <li>Fast. Where available, Gromit-MPX makes use of Compositing</li>
    </ul>
