# Tool and hot key configuration for Gromit-MPX.
#
# See https://github.com/bk138/gromit-mpx/blob/master/README.md#configuration
# for what you can configure here and how the syntax looks like.
#
# ❗ Once done editing, you have to manually restart Gromit-MPX to apply the
# made changes.
#
# Note that there is https://github.com/bk138/gromit-mpx/issues/110 which will
# eventually replace this with a proper UI.
