.SH NAME
Gromit-MPX \- Presentation helper to make annotations on screen
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gromit\-mpx
.RI [ options ]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBGromit-MPX\fP enables you to make multi-pointer annotations on your screen. It can run in
the background and be activated on demand to let you draw over all your
currently running applications. The drawing will stay on screen as long as you
want, you can continue to use your applications while the drawing is visible.
.br
\fBGromit-MPX\fP is XInput-Aware, so if you have a graphic tablet you can
draw lines with different strength, colour, erase things, etc.
.br
Since you typically want to use the program you are demonstrating and
highlighting something is a short interruption of you workflow,
Gromit-MPX is activated by either a hotkey or a repeated invocation of Gromit-MPX
(the latter can e.g. used by other applications or your windowmanager).
.br
.SH KEYBOARD CONTROL
By default, Gromit-MPX grabs the "F9" key (this can be changed using the
"\-\-key" option), making it unavailable to other application. The
available shortcuts are:
.TP
.B F9
toggle painting
.TP
.B SHIFT-F9
clear screen
.TP
.B CTRL-F9
toggle visibility
.TP
.B ALT-F9
quit Gromit-MPX
.PP
.SH OPTIONS (STARTUP)
A short summary of the available commandline arguments for invoking Gromit-MPX, see
below for the options to control an already running Gromit-MPX process:
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-active
start Gromit-MPX and immediately activate it.
.TP
.B \-k <keysym>, \-\-key <keysym>
will change the key used to grab the mouse. <keysym> can e.g. be
"F9", "F12", "Control_R" or "Print". To determine the keysym for
different keys you can use the \fBxev\fP(1) command. You can specify "none"
to prevent Gromit-MPX from grabbing a key.
.TP
.B \-K <keycode>, \-\-keycode <keycode>
will change the key used to grab the mouse. Under rare circumstances
identifying the key with the keysym can fail. You can then use the keycode
to specify the key uniquely. To determine the keycode for different keys you
can use the \fBxev\fP(1) command.
.TP
.B \-u <keysym>, \-\-undo\-key <keysym>
will change the key used to undo/redo strokes. <keysym> can e.g. be
"F9", "F12", "Control_R" or "Print". To determine the keysym for
different keys you can use the \fBxev\fP(1) command. You can specify "none"
to prevent Gromit-MPX from grabbing a key.
.TP
.B \-U <keycode>, \-\-undo\-keycode <keycode>
will change the key used to undo/redo strokes. Under rare circumstances
identifying the key with the keysym can fail. You can then use the keycode
to specify the key uniquely. To determine the keycode for different keys you
can use the \fBxev\fP(1) command.
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-debug
gives some debug output.
.SH OPTIONS (CONTROL)
A sort summary of the available commandline arguments to control an already
running Gromit-MPX process, see above for the options available to start Gromit-MPX.
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quit
will cause the main Gromit-MPX process to quit.
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-toggle
will toggle the grabbing of the cursor.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-visibility
will toggle the visibility of the window.
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-clear
will clear the screen.
.TP
.B \-z, \-\-undo
will undo the last drawing stroke.
.TP
.B \-y, \-\-redo
will redo the last undone drawing stroke.
.SH BUGS
When there is no compositing manager such as Compiz or xcompmgr
running, Gromit-MPX falls back to a legacy drawing mode. This may
drastically slow down your X-Server, especially when you draw very
thin lines. It makes heavy use of the shape extension, which is
quite expensive if you paint a complex pattern on screen. Especially
terminal-programs tend to scroll incredibly slow if something is
painted over their window.
